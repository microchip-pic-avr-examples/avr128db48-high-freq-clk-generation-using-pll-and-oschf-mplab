#  High-Frequency Clock Signal Generation for TCD using PLL and Internal High-Frequency RC Oscillator (OSCHF) using AVR128DB48

This code example shows how the PLL feature of AVR128DB48 generates a high-frequency clock signal for the TCD peripheral of the AVR Dx family. In this code example, the PLL module is supplied with an OSCHF as input, to generate 48 MHz clock at its output. The generated 48 MHz clock signal is used as a clock input by the TCD peripheral.

## Introduction

To support the control applications, various features are incorporated in the microcontrollers. The high-speed PWM signal has a resolution that benefits the audio amplifiers, SMPS, LED Lighting, Pulse Power conversions, H-bridge drive, equalization networks, volume controls and much more. The clock signal controls the conversion rate of data, clock speed and accuracy (in terms of waveform generation).

The AVR128DB48 microcontrollers of the AVR® DB family have an internal high-frequency oscillator (OSCHF), which maintains outputs frequencies up to 24 MHz and supports the range of frequencies. This device supports a simplified set of features. It includes the Timer/Counter type D (TCD) which is a high-performance waveform generator. It contains compare logic that generates two independent outputs. OSCHF can be used as a main clock, peripheral clock or also as an input to the Phased Lock Loop (PLL). The PLL can be used to increase the frequency of the clock source. This code example demonstrates a high frequency clock signal generation for TCD peripheral using PLL and OSCHF as its clock input. The PWM signals WOA and WOB are generated with different Set and Clear timings and can be observed on any oscilloscope.

## Description

This example shows how to generate a high-frequency clock signal for the TCD peripheral using the PLL feature with the OSCHF module. The TCD provides four different Waveform Generation modes. In this example, the TCD peripheral is configured in Two Ramp mode. The Compare A Set, Compare A Clear, Compare B Set, and Compare B Clear define when each state ends and begins. In Two Ramp mode, the TCD counter counts until it reaches the CMPACLR value, then it resets and counts until it reaches the CMPBCLR value. Here, the Compare A Set, Compare A Clear, Compare B Set, and Compare B Clear registers are set with 0 μs, 30 μs, 50 μs, and 80 μs values respectively. The PWM signals generated are routed to output on WOA and WOB. The signals generated on the WOA and WOB pins will have duty cycle of 10% and 20% respectively.

## Application Firmware

The example firmware uses a TCD peripheral to scale up the system clock frequency. In this firmware, the system clock is configured to operate at 24 MHz. The TCD peripheral is configured to run at 48 MHz with PLL as its clock input. Here, the PLL multiplication factor is set to 2x to scale up the input clock frequency. Configure the TCD peripheral in Two Ramp mode. The compare Set and Clear registers A, B are loaded with 10 μs, 30 μs, 50 μs and 80 μs. The TCD peripheral is configured in two ramp mode. The waveform outputs are observed when the TCD peripheral is enabled.

## Demo Operation
